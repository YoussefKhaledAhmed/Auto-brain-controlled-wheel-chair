# Auto-brain-controlled-wheel-chair
## Description:
Controlling a wheelchair manually or automatically via EEG signals using the SSVEP technique by recording signals from the brain using CyKit, then processing these signals through some steps: Filtering, applying Welch method, Then extract features from the output of the welch, Then Training the Machine learning models: SVC, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, the training phase was via GridSearchCV and then deploying the trained ML model on real-time signals and sending the prediction of the ML model to one of two destinations, one: the microcontroller that will drive the motors, two: to the ROS system that will send the signals to the microcontroller, It depends on the output of the machine learning model as if this output is directions then the output will be sent directly to the microcontrollers, but if the output is location then this output will go to ROS which will send the directions to the microcontroller according to the map in the ROS community.
